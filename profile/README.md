# Welcome to OpenGK!

Our goal is to open source the Hyundai/Kia Siemens ECMs on the Beta and Delta motors to provide tuning options to the DIY enthusiasts. This project originally started for the Hyundai Coupe/Tuscani/Tiburon platform but as we collected more data from other platforms with similar ECMs, it was clear that those other platforms can be supported using the same principals.

We are looking for smart individuals that have experience with Ghidra/IDA Pro and disassembly that are willing to help push this project further. Please contact info(at)opengk.org or join our [https://discord.gg/yJretRsM8g](Discord) if you would like to contribute to this project.

If you are a tuner and found this site to be useful, please consider a donation to Paypal: donate(at)opengk.org to help keep the site alive.
